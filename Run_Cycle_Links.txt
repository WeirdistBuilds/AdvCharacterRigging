3 Positive Observations about Stewart Rig: Loved the Spine Curvature node, the flipper-finger joints, and the all-in-one leg/foot joint.
3 Negative Observations about Stewart Rig: I was a bit confused on how to bob the head appropriately, how to properly rotate the clavicle with the motion, or how to export a smoothbody rather than the block version.
(All in all, I'd say this is my favorite rig so far to work with. One hundred, thousand, thousand times more intuitive and cooperative than MAX_RIG.)
